## Ubuntu Quick Install

Follow these steps to quickly set up KUVPN on Ubuntu:

1. **Install Rust and Cargo using rustup**:

   To install Rust & GCC and Cargo, you will use the rustup script. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl gcc
   ```

   You will also need curl to run the command.

   ```
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   After running the script, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once the installation is finished, you will need to restart your terminal session for the changes to take effect.

   **Alternatively, you can use the following command to reload your shell without closing the terminal:**

   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

   This command updates your current shell session with the new environment variables set by Rust.

2. **Install Chromium and ChromeDriver**:

   If you plan to use the Chrome browser for KUVPN, you will need to install Chromium and its corresponding ChromeDriver:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
   ```

   As ubuntu insalls snaps for browsers, we must use devmode as to allow for the profile creation. 
   ```bash
   sudo snap install chromium --devmode
   ```

   If you already had it installed please remove it again, install again from the command above:
   ```bash
   sudo snap remove chromium
   ```

3. **Install KUVPN**:

   With Rust and Cargo installed, you can now install KUVPN directly from the Git repository:

   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/ealtun21/kuvpn
   ```

4. **Run KUVPN**:

   Once KUVPN is installed, you can run it with the default settings:

   ```bash
   kuvpn
   ```

   Or, if you want to customize the connection parameters, use:

   ```bash
   kuvpn --url https://vpn.ku.edu.tr --port 9515
   ```

That's it! You're all set up and ready to use KUVPN on Ubuntu. Enjoy!
